### Hi there 👋
### About Me

- 🔭 Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer
- 🌱 Applied machine learning and system designs that support the platforms and products of large institutions currently pique my interest. I am interested in:
    - How they frame their problems 🔎(e.g., personalization as recsys vs. search vs. sequences)
    - What machine learning techniques worked ✅ (and sometimes, what didn't ❌)
    - What real-world results were achieved (so one can better assess ROI ⏰💰📈)
- I have recently been working on forecasting and recommendation systems and applying them to solve problems in the supply chain industry application in inventory management, and recommending new items to enhance revenue and reduce shortages, minimize expenses.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on application of data science and ML techniques to solve finance, ecommerce, supply chain, health and practical problems.
