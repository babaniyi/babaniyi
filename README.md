### Hi there 👋
### About Me

- 🔭 Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently interested in the applied machine learning and system designs behind leading companies products and platforms. In particular, I'm interested in:
    - How the problem is framed 🔎(e.g., personalization as recsys vs. search vs. sequences)
    - What machine learning techniques worked ✅ (and sometimes, what didn't ❌)
    - Why it works, the science behind it with research, literature, and references 📂
    - What real-world results were achieved (so one can better assess ROI ⏰💰📈)

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on application of data science and ML techniques to solve finance, ecommerce, supply chain, health and practical problems.
- 💬 Ask me about Data Science, Statistics and Machine Learning.
